## Instructions

- .env file must be placed in the main folder.

## Modules selection

The project requires a total of 125 points to complete module requirements. This can be achieved by selecting:

* 7 Major modules and 5 Minor modules
or
* 8 Major modules and 3 Minor modules

### Major modules (mandatory : 7 or more)

1. Use a Framework to build the backend.
2. Standard user management, authentication, users across tournaments.
3. Designing the Backend as Microservices.
4. Infrastructure Setup for Log Managementy
5. Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT.
6. ImplementWAF/ModSecurity with Hardened Configuration and HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management.
7. Implementing a remote authentication.
8. Store the score of a tournament in the Blockchain. (for emauduit ?)

### Minor modules

1. Use a framework or a toolkit to build the frontend.
2. Use a database for the backend.
3. Support on all devices.
4. Expanding Browser Compatibility.
5. Multiple language supports.
6. Add accessibility for Visually Impaired Users.
7. GDPRComplianceOptionswithUserAnonymization, Local Data Management, and Account Deletion.
8. Monitoring system.
9. User and Game Stats Dashboards.

## Project planification

Hereâ€™s the recommended approach in English to help structure the ft_transcendence project and ensure a smooth, progressive development process.

1. __Initial Planning and Configuration__
* Set up development environments (Docker, containerization) to ensure consistency, especially for microservices management.
* Select and install a Django framework (Module 1 - Major) _as the foundation for all other backend components, ensuring compatibility with a microservices architecture_ :
    - Installation : 
2. __Core Backend Modules__
* Standard User Management and Authentication (Module 2 - Major)
_This functionality is crucial as it provides the foundation for all user interactions, including tournaments and scoring. Integrate authentication elements like sessions and secure storage for user information._
* Microservices Architecture for Backend (Module 3 - Major)
_Design the backend as microservices to avoid tight coupling and make future additions easier. For instance, create separate services for user management and tournament handling._
* Database Integration (Module 2 - Minor)
_Configure a centralized and performant database to handle information management. This will support user and tournament data storage efficiently._
3. __Security and Data Management Modules__
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT (Module 5 - Major)
_Secure user login with two-factor authentication and JWT tokens for sessions._
* Web Application Firewall (WAF) and HashiCorp Vault (Module 6 - Major)
_Implement a WAF to protect the application from common attacks, and configure HashiCorp Vault to manage sensitive data and secrets._
* Log Management Infrastructure (Module 4 - Major)
_Set up centralized log management for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting, which is particularly useful in a microservices environment._
4. __Frontend Development and User Experience__
* Framework or Toolkit for the Frontend (Module 1 - Minor)
_Choose a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) to build the user interface quickly and ensure compatibility with the backend. Start by integrating views for user authentication and management._
* Multi-Device Support and Browser Compatibility (Modules 3 and 4 - Minor)
_Adapt the UI for usage across devices (desktop, tablet, smartphone) and ensure key functionalities are compatible with multiple browsers._
* Accessibility (Module 6 - Minor)
_Add accessibility elements to make the application usable for visually impaired users._
* Multiple language supports (Module 5 - Minor)
_Add multiple languages (french and english) with a button to select the language._
5. __Advanced Features and Customization__
* User and Game Stats Dashboards (Module 9 - Minor)
_Design dashboards to display user and game stats, encouraging engagement and adding value for active users._
6. __Compliance and Monitoring__
* GDPR Compliance and Personal Data Management (Module 7 - Minor)
_Ensure GDPR compliance with options for account deletion and personal data management to meet privacy requirements._
* Monitoring System (Module 8 - Minor)
_Set up monitoring to track performance, usage, and detect anomalies._
7. __Bonus Features and Blockchain Integration__
* Remote Authentication (Module 7 - Major)
_If possible, add remote authentication to expand login options, such as Google or other services._
* Blockchain for Tournament Scores (Module 8 - Major, optional)
_Use blockchain to store tournament scores for transparent and immutable tracking._
